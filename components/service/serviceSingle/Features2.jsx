              1h drive from Zagreb | 2-3h average visit duration | half day trip (can be combined with Kumrovec for a full day trip)

Located in northern Croatia along the Slovenian border, just an hour drive from Zagreb, Castle Trakošćan (pronounced trákoshchan) is the most iconic, best preserved Croatian castle. Originally built in the 13th century as part of Croatia's northwestern line of fortifications, it changed owners several times before ultimately being nationalized and turned into a museum in mid 20th century. While not as impressive as the castles of Austria or Bavaria, Trakošćan, with its adjacent lake and forest park, remains well worth a visit, especially on sunny days.

This trip can be extended to include a visit to the Old Village Kumrovec, with a 45 min drive between the two locations, or else done standalone with an optional stop at the Roses Designer Outlet, and a lunch option at a recommended countryside restaurant in the area.

                Most notable for being the birthplace of Josip Broz Tito, the president of Yugoslavia, Kumrovec (pronounced kúmrovets) is a small village near the Slovenian border in northern Croatia. Though the village still lives and breathes through its couple hundred residents, the oldest, central part of it has been converted into a permanent ethnological museum. It showcases the architecture, artifacts, and general way of village life as it existed at the turn of the 19th to 20th century.

                When combined with a visit to Trakošćan Castle, it is recommended to see the castle first, followed by a 45min drive to Kumrovec, with a lunch option at an excellent countryside restaurant in view of another, smaller castle nearby.

Once the favored seaside retreat of the Austro-Hungarian nobility, Opatija (pronounced ópatiya) is widely known as one of Croatia's most beautiful coastal towns and the oldest seaside resort on the east coast of the Adriatic Sea, with its tourist history dating back to mid 19th century. Originally a fishing town located at the doorstep of the Istrian peninsula, modern-day Opatija is a highly popular destination made famous by its numerous hotels, restaurants, parks, and the Lungomare promenade; an enchanting 12km seafront walkway that spans several other coastal towns.

While a day or two could be taken to fully explore the area, Opatija makes for a perfect day trip from Zagreb, being only a two hour drive away. Alternatively, it could be a pleasant stop on the way to other destinations in Istria.

Motovun is a walled medieval town situated on a hill 270m above sea level in central Istria, on the site of an ancient Italian settlement. The town's three parts are connected by a system of fortifications including multiple towers and city gates, built under the influences from Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance styles. It features a stunning 360° view of the surrounding valley encircled by other hills, and the forest of Motovun which is famous for its prized black and white truffles.

Owing to its small size and central location, Motovun makes for a great scenic stop on the way to other destinations in Istria, with lunch options ranging from mid tier restaurants up on the hill, to the prestigious Zigante truffle restaurant down in the valley.

Most famous for the well-preserved Roman amphitheatre that is today referred to as the Arena of Pula, this is the largest city on the Istrian peninsula, situated near its southern tip. Pula has had a turbulent history, having been occupied, destroyed, and rebuilt multiple times, with Rome, Venice, Austro-Hungary, and Italy all administering the city at some point in history, before it was finally secured as Croatian territory in the late 1940s alongside the rest of Istria.

Besides the Arena, other points of interest include the Temple of Augustus, the first Roman emperor, as well as the Pula Citadel, a 1600s Venetian-built defensive fortress with great views overlooking the city.

Originally a fishing town on the western coast of the Istrian peninsula, Rovinj (pronounced rovínj, with the 'nj' sounding like the 'n' in 'new') is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Croatia. The town's highlights include the old town and harbor, the Church of St. Euphemia located on top of the hill overlooking the rest of the old town, and a dozen small islands scattered just off coast.

With its scenic location and numerous hotels and restaurants, Rovinj makes for a great daytrip from Zagreb or a stepping stone to other destinations in Istria.

Being the oldest, largest, and most popular national park in Croatia, Plitvice Lakes (pronounced plítvitse) almost needs no introduction. Part of the UNESCO World Heritage list since 1979, the park is known for its sixteen lakes cascading through the canyon, the surrounding lush forests, and diverse plant and animal life, which attract well over a million nature lovers, photographers, and outdoor enthusiasts each year. The park has two entrances and two parts, those being the upper and lower lakes, with most of the points of interest being in the lower lakes. It usually takes just a few hours for a visit, with an overnight stay being necessary to see the entire park.

Located about halfway between the coast and Zagreb, a two hour drive each way, the park is ideally placed to serve as either a daytrip or part of your continued journey through the country, with no shortage of hotels and private accommodation for those wanting to take the time to fully explore the area. Important note: Due to the park's popularity, it is virtually required to secure tickets online at least a day, (recommended a couple of days), ahead of time.

Zadar combines the charm of ancient Roman ruins with medieval churches and modern marvels such as the Sea Organ and Salutation to the Sun.

                A daytrip to Zadar usually involves a walk down the waterfront and exploration of the old town, with plenty of recommended lunch options in the town itself, with the possibility of visiting one of the wineries or other smaller towns nearby.
